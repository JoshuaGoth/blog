## Who are any of us?

I can rattle on about my successes and failures. I could tell you that my first memories were that of my father trying to kill my mother and me, or that I spent the better part of my childhood in between anything that resembled stability. I could tell you that in spite of statistics, that I made something of myself, and that it is possible for some that are born into abuse can escape, and become some of the best partners and parents the planet has ever seen.

But what do you really want to know? I wont sell you stories that will alter your opinion of me, but what I can do is write about what I know, and the lessons that I have learned that helped craft me into the person that I am today.

I want to be real with you. No, I am going to be real with you. I am going to talk about very real topics, and share with you what I learned on the way that not only enabled me to excel in spite of unimaginable hardships, but taught me how to heal from afflictions, of which, have no known cure. A journey that led to me discover. . .

I implore you to listen with an open mind, and open heart, as I work to not tell you about who I am, but instead show you through lessons learned from a hopeless past, filled with none other than pain, sorrow, and hardships unimaginable. This is my journey of refusal. Refusal to quit. Refusal stay down. Refusal to give up on someone that never mattered. . . myself.
